## IMAGES
Insert images in a md file is very similar as using links.
As well as links, there are two types of images and renderizes in the same way as links do.
**The difference between links and imaages is that, later are preceded by !.**
The first image style is _inline image_, for inserting an inline image first goes the exclamation followed by [] in which text must go, then in round brackets goes the link of the image.
ie. ![text](image).

In the same way referenced links work, referenced images does. In the first square brackets must be the text of the image, followed by square brackets with tag. Later on the file thaat tag will reference a image.
